Please feel free to create issues for things that might be wrong or pull requests for updating things that are inaccurate. 
These are concise, fully searchable, wiki-style markdown pages to help you while you are studying for the class. 

To use you must have Obsidian.md. You can download it here: https://obsidian.md/
To use this, you can either clone this to your own machine, or hit the <code> button on the repository page and download a zip file.

If you want to help, you can either fork the notes to your own environment and create a pull request, or create an issue.
My schedule, tentative of the course, is to have the notes for the section layed out by at least Wednesday, to study for the quiz whenever I am comfortable taking it Thursday-Sunday. 

Good luck to everyone this semester! Please don't be afraid to reach out if you have questions.
