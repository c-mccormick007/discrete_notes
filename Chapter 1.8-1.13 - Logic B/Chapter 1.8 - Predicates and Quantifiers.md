## [[Predicate|Predicates]] & Mathematical Statements

Mathematical statements with variables aren't propositions until the variable is defined. For example:

- "$x$ is an odd number":
  - True if $x = 5$
  - False if $x = 4$

Such statements are called **predicates**, expressed as functions like $P(x)$. If $P(x)$ is "x is an odd number," then $P(5)$ is a true proposition ("5 is an odd number").

### Predicates with Multiple Variables:
- $Q(x, y) : x^2 = y$ (e.g., $Q(5, 25)$ is true)
- $R(x, y, z) : x + y = z$ (e.g., $R(2, 3, 6)$ is false)

### Domain:
The **domain** of a variable is the set of all possible values. For example, the domain for "$x$ is an odd number" is all integers.

### Non-Mathematical Predicates:
Predicates aren't limited to math. For example, "The city has a population over $1,000,000$":

- True if the city is New York
- False if the city is Toledo

Even if $P(x)$ is true for all $x$, it's still a predicate if it contains a variable (e.g., $P(x) = x + 1 > 1$).
