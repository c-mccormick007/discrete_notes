![[Argument]]

## [[Argument]]:

An argument is **valid** if the conclusion is true for every truth assignment to the variables that causes all the hypotheses to be true, otherwise the argument is **invalid**.

| $h_1$          |
| -------------- |
| $h_2$          |
| $...$          |
| $h_n$          |
| $\therefore c$ |
$h_1 ... h_n$ are the hypothesis and $c$ is the conclusion. The $\therefore$ symbol reads as 'therefore.' The [[Argument]] is valid when $(h_1 \land h_2 ~ \land ~  ... ~ \land  ~h_n) \to c$ is a [[Tautology]]. 

Reordering the hypotheses does not change whether an argument is valid or not. The following are the same:

## The form of an argument:

These can also be expressed in English.
![[Pasted image 20240828145653.png]]
The form of an argument expressed in English is obtained by replacing each individual proposition with a variable. 

$p$: It is raining today.
$q$: I will not ride my bike to school. 

The argument's form, given below, was already shown to be valid by using a truth table:
