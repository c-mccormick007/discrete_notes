**Conjunction** is a [[Logical operation]] that combines two [[Proposition|propositions]] and returns true only if both propositions are true. It is typically denoted by the symbol "âˆ§" and is equivalent to the logical "and" in English. If either or both propositions are false, the conjunction is false.
