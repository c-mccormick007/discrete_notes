## If two [[Proposition|propositions]] are logically equivalent:

One can be subbed for the other within a more complex [[Proposition]].
The compound proposition after the substitution is [[Logically Equivalent]] to the [[Compound proposition]] before the substitution. 

example:
$p → q  ≡ ¬p ∨ q$ , therefore
$(p \lor r) \land (\neg p \lor q) \equiv (p \lor r) \land (p \to q)$
