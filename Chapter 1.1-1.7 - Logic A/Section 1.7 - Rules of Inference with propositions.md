If the [[Proposition]] in a step is a hypothesis, the justification is "Hypothesis." Otherwise, the proposition must follow from previous steps by applying one law of logic or rule of inference.

- $c$: The game will be cancelled

Replacing English phrases with variable names results in the following argument form:
